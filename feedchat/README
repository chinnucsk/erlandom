%%%
%%%	This is inspired by the sample code of chat server from "Programming Erlang" by Joe Armstrong
%%%
%%%	Chat Server -> as the sample is
%%%	feed view -> tail -N of feed history
%%%	           or,   tail -f -N =:= friendfeed
%%%	
%%%	chat server process : implemented by CouchDB
%%%	    RSS entry = document
%%%	    DB = history (w/ time stamp)
%%%	
%%%	this is cheapest implementation of friendfeed
%%%	
%%%	
%%%	Map-Reduce (query against CouchDB) view point
%%%	    Map : crunch feed via XMPP or Pubsubhubbub...
